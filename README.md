This is a little exercise with an express server and a React front-end.

To run the server:

```
cd autocomplete-sandbox-backend
npm install
npm start
```

To run the client:

```
cd autocomplete-sandbox-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

By default the server run in `http://localhost:3000` and the client in `http://localhost:3001`
